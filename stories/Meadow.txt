The meadow is brightly lit and full of flowers.
There is a pleasant breeze blowing through, heavy with a sweet floral scent.
There doesn't appear to be anything dangerous nearby.
You feel at ease, yawning as the excitement for today left you with little sleep the night before.
Perhaps you'd like to take a @@nap@@ here before continuing so your refreshed and ready for anything.
Or maybe you'd like to try your hand at botany, or even alchemy, and start @@examining@@ the flowers for useful ingredients.
Or maybe the meadow is too boring for you, and you'd like to explore the @@woods@@ instead.

What will you do?
