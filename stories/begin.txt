You are a young human, coming of age in a land of myth and magic.
You decide it's time to leave the nest, and seek your fortune out in the world.
You leave your home, waving goodbye to your family, walking boldly down the path ahead of you.

The path leads you to a small town you have visited  a few times before.
Hunched in the middle of it all is a large buslting tavern.

Would you like to go into the tavern?

**Tavern** or **No tavern**
