# Adventure
A simple choose your own adventure (not complete)

I just wanted to practice some coding by making a choose your own adventure game.

I've already learned quite a lot, really.
My first attempt (on a different repository) mostly involved if statements and the text kept sliding farther and farther to the right, so it was getting harder to read.

So the second attempt (still available in prototypes) each call was a function, so I could call them individually instead of going farther and farther over with if statemnts. This also made it easier to call back to other decisions.

On the 3rd iteration, I tried attempting to add a GUI with tkinter, which has also been quite the learning process.  I had to completely switch around how I thought about the choices in order to make the buttons work.  But I'm slowly getting there.

Now I'm on the 4th iteration.  I was really struggling with my previous GUI trying to change the functions for the buttons and such.  So I got a little help, and now it works much better.  I even added a way to revisit previous choices so you can skip ahead to where you left off.

If you want to test it by all means, go ahead.
It SHOULD be playable - though the current file doesn't have much actual content yet.
The Adventure2.py file in the prototypes has more of the content, but even then, not every path has an ending yet. If it comes up with "Placeholder" that's a route that hasn't been completed yet.
But it should allow you to play again after that.
