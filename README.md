# Adventure
A simple choose your own adventure (not complete)

I just wanted to practice some coding by making a choose your own adventure game.

I've already learned quite a lot, really.
My first attempt (on a different repository) mostly involved if statements and the text kept sliding farther and farther to the right, so it was getting harder to read.
So this time I'm calling functions, so it doesn't keep tabbing over.
It also makes it easier to call back to other decisions. 

If you want to test it by all means, go ahead.
It SHOULD be playable - though not every route has endings yet.
If it comes up with "Placeholder" that's a route that hasn't been completed yet.
But it should allow you to play again after that.
