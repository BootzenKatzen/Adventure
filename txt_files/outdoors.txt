You decide to skip the tavern.
Maybe you suspect the local quests will be lackluster.
Maybe you think you shouldn't be drinking this early in the day.
In either case, you pass by it and come to the edge of town.
Before you there are two paths: 

To the right, past a farmer's feild is a large beautiful meadow, full of flowers.

To the left is a dark and dangerous looking woods, the path barely visible in the gloom.
